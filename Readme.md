# Full-Fledged Modern Javascript Application 

This is the repository for the Modern Javascript Series on Scripted. This series will build a modern application from start, run through the development phases of a production ready, tested, and scalable application all the way to its deployment on Amazon Web Services.

Working in phases we will build a quiz application. This application will use React and Redux sitting in front of a collection of microservice Node applications with Seneca.
